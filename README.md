# The Summa Humana Corpus

This is who we are.

A collection of works that represent humanity's search to understand itself.

Organized for humans, AI, and human-AI collaborators, to explore.

## Categories of Work

We aspire for this corpus to include a full representation of human writing concerning:

- Religion and Spirituality
- Philosophy and Natural Philosophy
- Ethics and Morality
- Love and Relationships
- Governance and Human Rights

## Categories of Work Not Included

This corpus does not intend to include works whose primary categorization would be considered:

- Mathematics, science, and engineering
- Literature
- History

## Requirements for Inclusion

All works must be in the public domain or include an attestation of permission from the rights holder.

- If you the rights holder of a work deserving inclusion, consider donating your work to Summa Humana!
- If you would like to contribute a work that is rights-restricted, consider contributing a public domain summary instead. It can be logged as a version of the work.
